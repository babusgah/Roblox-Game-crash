To crash people that join your game put this as the title of your game "x64DBG BinaryNinja Ghidra IDA GDB OllyDBG Radare2"
Also if they have the game open as the tab they wont even be able to open Roblox.

How it works : Roblox anticheat detects those strings as a cracking software which when you join the game roblox sees it and gives you a error telling you to uninstall that program 

Note that it only works Windows Systems.
